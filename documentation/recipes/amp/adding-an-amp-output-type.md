# Implementing AMP

## What is AMP?

[Accelerated Mobile Pages](https://www.ampproject.org/) (AMP) is an open-source initiative from Google that aims to make your site really, really fast.

Here's how to set it up.

## Setting up AMP using the Core Component

You'll want to set up AMP via Output Type -- this will allow you to set up all the boilerplate that AMP requires in one, easy to access spot.

[Here's a whole bunch more information about what AMP requires to be in the head of the page.](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/fundamentals/spec)

If you want to get up and running with the boilerplate even faster, [take a look at our example implementation within this repo](./../components/output-types/amp.jsx).

You can copy and paste this code directly. [Take a look at the ReadMe](./../../../components/output-types/ReadMe.md) to see what's going on in there.
