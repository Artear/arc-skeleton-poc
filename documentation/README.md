By the time you've worked through these recipes, you'll be able to:

- Mock multisite up locally, so you can preview any page from any website in your organization.
- Set up a site property so you can render DFP ads within PageBuilder.
- Wire up your repo with different fonts, if different websites have different requirements.
- Set up base stylesheets for your entire organization, and extend them (if needed) for individual sites.
